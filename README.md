# SkeletonWars
This gem allows you to view skeletal parts as a list and as pictures. Lists and pictures from Wolfram Alpha but organized into subgroups in a more navigatable manner.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'skeleton-wars-prep'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install skeleton-wars-prep
    
Note that some gems require you to have ImageMagick

## Usage

Use arrow keys to navigate between CLI options.

## Development

You can also run `bin/start` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
